5.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,"I make a fancy bed for my cats with a $40 basket and pillow from a fancy human furniture store.  They go for the free cardboard box with an old towel thrown in it.  I buy them cute toys.  They go for a crumpled up piece of paper.  I buy expensive canned food and Friskies.  They go for Friskies.  Sure, expensive food usually has better ingredients and makes ME feel better about feeding it to my cats.  But will they eat it?  That's a gamble.  But Friskies, yeah, they'll gobble it all up."
3.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,"I ordered this by mistake.  I STRONGLY prefer pate because it plops out of the can with a few shakes.  This isn't pate.  The cats like it well enough, so in fairness I have to say that, for those who do not hate scraping stinky ooey-gooey cat food out of the can with a spatula or spoon, it's a nice product.  For that reason, I gave it three stars instead of one.  As far as I'm concerned, cat food in gravy is a pain and I can hardly wait to use it up.  In the future, I'll read the text more carefully."
2.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,"My boys have been getting this product for years! Normally they love it! This last one...well the labels say one thing but the food is the same thing.
Like one said tuna, cheese and it was chicken and corn. They all are chicken and corn. I am not getting this again. I know this can be a ""over sight"" in production. But this isn't the first time. Its just the last time."
2.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,"None of our 7 cats will eat this with the big chunks of something similar to cold meat or bologna. We smash it with a fork and they still don't like it. From what I've read concerning feline diets, most do not like big pieces of anything and especially when it's of this texture. I do not recommend this food. So much goes to waste"
5.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,"It is a good cat food, but I read it wrong, I guess...as I thought it was Pate as my cats will not eat it, so I have to
put it in my grinder to make it more liquid and add a little of people packaged gravy to it..three times, as they just lick the liquid and leave the solid, they finally get it eaten, but it takes awhile as I have to keep adding my gravy liquid to get it lapped up...it is fine for other cats, but my cats only eat, I should say lick up Pate"
4.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,"My cats have always loved Friskies wet food, but I was tired of buying a bunch of single cans until I found this. Not only does it come in bulk but it lasts and doesn't leave me running back and forth to the store. My cats also love the flavor, I had never seen it before."
2.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,I like to give my older cat different types of soft food cause everyone likes variety. Unfortunately she barely touched this kind. she takes maybe 2 bits and walks away.
5.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,My cats wont eat any other kind. They prefer this brand wet food and dry good. The shreds are particularly what they like.
3.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,"I bought this because cats normally like cheese; however, I discovered that my outside cats are not that fond of these flavors.  They do eat it but not like they do other flavors."
5.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,Three feral cats let me cater to them. They all love this food - especially the variety of flavors. Affordable and quite tasty - so they tell me. Thanks Chewy!

5.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,"This brand with the variety, Oliver seems to like.  But he's 18yrs old and he can get fuzzy.  I just have to figure him out every 2-3 months. His treats he loves.  
Your service people are wonderful. They try to suggest other thing for Oliver.  Your staff is well trained."

5.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,"When I inherited my cat from my mom she always claimed Roxy loves the kind of Friskies with cheese.  Sometimes it's not at the stores, so it's nice I can always get it from Chewy.  She does love her cheese."

1.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,We are brand new at owner’s and our 1.5 year oldcat doesn’t like this foodat all. Our first purchase was afood with Tiny in the name and she seemed to like it better. We are just trying to decide what works best for her with her dry food. We think it’s a texture thing. This food is like stringy beef and the other is a pate. Just thought I’d share with others.
5.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,"Our cats prefer this flavor above all others. Good price. Good value, good quality

4.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,So hard to find moist food for all my picky 10. But I have reordered this 3 times so it's working. Wish it was one of the healthier recipes but guess that's why they all like it.
5.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,My two picky cats eat these flavors right up! One cat weighs 18 pounds and is a hungry boy! I'm glad to have found something he likes!

5.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,I feed feral’s in our area. They love this mix of Friskies Treasures with cheese.
3.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,Being a Friskies brand I just knew my cat's would like it but they would take a couple of licks and walk away. Wasted most of the case.

Just as in the picture in the box, the younger one stands up on her hind feet and once jumped up on the countertop in her eagerness to start eating this!! They eat all the different versions in the case I bought, so I am buying more, lol!!"
5.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,Just like people most cats like a variety of flavors and meats. This variety pack has a great selection of meats that also includes cheese so it really fills the requirements of what my cats love to eat.

5.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,I used this food to wean a stray kitten off the bottle. He was having trouble chewing and wouldn't even eat hard food softened with milk. He is about 7 months old now and absolutely loves his Tasty Treasures.
5.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,My cat loves having a bit added to her dry food and “reminds” me if I haven’t given her enough!
1.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,"Most of the time my cats like this food. This recent order of two cases of 24, they did not eat. They would smell it and walk away. Not even a taste. I thought it was that my cats were being picky, but the colony I help with didn’t eat it either. I threw out whole plates of food. 
Not ok"

5.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,My fussy kitty will sniff and walk away from almost every canned food. Give hi Friskies Tasty Treasures and he will eat the entire can.
5.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,I have two cats who absolutely love this food. I plan to continue getting them this food.
1.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,They will not eat this food  only like Pate.  It is my mistake I was in a hurry should have read the ad.

2.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,"I was very disappointed. The box of canned cat food was open,cans were all over in the package. The cans were all damaged, some really badly damaged. Looks like someone dropped the case and then just threw it in the shipping box."
2.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,"I got these because my cats (4 of them) like the gravy and cheese it the product, but when I opened the box, some of the cans were damaged. some bent up and mishandled. now i cant always blame Chew for this, sometimes you got to lay the blame in the postal service. it is just my cats wont eat out of a can that has been dented or cracked open, I guess they can smell that it is bad and they try to cover it like it was laying in the cat litter box. From now on I will stick to the other can foods I ordered before, they seem to get here Undamaged."
5.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,My three cats love the cheese variety pack Friskies! I have not been able to find this in my area.
1.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,"Out of the 24 cans, which arrived very quickly, more than half were dented.  Dont know if the denting affected the food inside, but my cat, Max, would not eat it.  I tried all three flavors, but no go.  He stuck his nose up at every one!  

I like to shop at Chewy, and I would not give you a bad rating, but you really should look at the condition of the cans.  Maybe it’s just my cat being fussy, but he usually eats everything else.  Maybe change your supplier."
5.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,"Our three cats love cheese and they love these cans full of little cheese bits.  One of our cats actually checks each food dish served and when she sees some chesse bits in her food, she gives a look of happy satisfaction."

5.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,My cat absolutely loves this mixture and taste from Friskies tasty Treasures wet food! Everyday he is hungry to eat his wet food. He doesn't like pate and pretty much anything that's not chicken but he loves all the flavors from this pack. Gravy is the key ingredient. It's a win!!

5.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,"I have 2 cats and they love  this variety of food. There was choices but they both love every one of these. When they are happy, we are happy & satisfied"
5.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,"My Felicia loves these treasures, especially those with a certain cheesyness. I mix wet food with dry food for kittens, about 50-50. The moisture content and saucyness of these meals makes it really easy to mix with the dry food. The flavor options are amazing and even make me a little envyness that I don't have human meals that appealing.  ;-)"
3.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,My cats are eating this canned food.  They are not too found of the chicken & Cheese flavor.  I alternate this with other brand foods for variety.

5.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,My cats love this cat food assortment. They just about mug me when they hear me open the can ! Lol
4.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,My cat is 15+ years old and it has been difficult to find food she will eat. I have tried the very expensive on down the line price wise...she would not eat it. I finally tried her on Friskies pate' and she ate that fairly well until a few weeks ago. I found the Tasty Treasures with Cheese on Chewy and decided to try it. I have been mixing it half and half with her other Friskies and she is eating better than she has in years. She comes to me and meows for it and she has not done that before.
5.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,My kitties devour this food. There is enough gravy to make them happy.
5.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,My 4 furbabies are always hungry and they seem to love the cheesy treasures. There is never any left over when they get done taking turns licking out everybody's bowls.
5.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,"I'm looking for discounted cat foods since I have a little family outside now, in addition to my 3 inside cats. I found these on sale. My cats LOVE this."
5.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,"Usually when I get a variety pack, there is one flavor the cats won't eat. This is the exception. My cats like all four flavors."
5.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,I tried expensive canned food but this seems like they only like this one. The price is great and delivery is prompt
1.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,"I have ordered canned food about 6 times and not once did I receive an order WITHOUT dented cans. My order I received Thursday was so dented the food was leaking out of it. As much as I love Chewy, I think I will stop ordering canned food as I feel like Chewy is selling the rejects that can't go to the grocery or discount stores."
4.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,"My cats love wet cat food.  Although, one of the can cracked open but otherwise, everything is fine.  Arrive on time."

3.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,"My cats eat like they are starved then they barf it up.
I’m going to stick with pate blends.
They do love the treasures but I don’t like barf"
5.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,This one by far is their favorite. Every cat loved it. They even have to lick the can clean!

5.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,"Cats love it. Wish it came in the large cans. With 25 to feed I mix it with the larger cans of poultry, fish, Turkey & giblets."
5.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,i usually order fancy feast. i tried this for my fussy cats. they really liked it
5.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,I use just a spoonful or two at a time and then cover the can and put in the fridge til the evening for a little more.  My cat likes it and eats it right up.
2.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,"Every single can was dented. Other orders I’ve placed have had broken items. Yes, Chewy is good about replacing broken things and they offered a refund on the dented cans, but I just want to order things that come in good condition in the first place."
5.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,"My cats love these flavors of wet cat food, it’s a nice change from dry cat food."
5.0,friskies-tasty-treasures-cheese,12.72,24,5.5,I got this for my old kitty who was overeating his dry food and puking it back on the floor. he hasn't done that since I started giving him a scoop of this in the morning. He also has a little more pep in his step.
5.0,fancy-feast-poultry-beef-classic-pate,13.21,24,3.0,"I was a little nervous in purchasing this product as I had never given Izzy this brand before. I should not have worried. He LOVED it from the time I popped the top on the first can !!! If I'm not up early enough for him in the mornings, he jumps on the bed and starts ""talking"" so I'll get up...lol  Next time I'm buying the bigger pack !!!"
4.0,fancy-feast-poultry-beef-classic-pate,13.21,24,3.0,"my cat is 18 yrs old and eats 2 cans of this a day or more.  She gets hungry every 3 hrs.  I dont give her the beef too often, it kinda gives her loose stools. the only time shes not crying is between 10 am and 4 pm when she sleeps.  Cats are really mysterious."
4.0,fancy-feast-poultry-beef-classic-pate,13.21,24,3.0,"I have one special diet cat, and one who can eat anything, so I have these little cans on hand for special treats for him and he loves them. Also, my cat has no teeth (he was a rescue) and the pate is so easy for him to eat. He loves all the choices."
4.0,fancy-feast-poultry-beef-classic-pate,13.21,24,3.0,"So, the packaging says that there are 8 cans of each flavor inside.  Not so.  My package had 6 turkey & giblets feast, 8 tender beef feast, and 10 chicken feast.  I know this isn't chewy's fault because it arrived in a sealed package.  But strange nonetheless."
3.0,fancy-feast-poultry-beef-classic-pate,13.21,24,3.0,My cat seems to have gotten out of the fancy feast craze of late. He eats half a can in the morning when hungry and refuses the rest . Changing flavors with the mixed offerings of pate hasn’t changed that habit. He flatly refuses the chunky turkey cans now as well. What to do?
5.0,fancy-feast-poultry-beef-classic-pate,13.21,24,3.0,"My cats love this cat food. I have tried several types of canned foods this year but this is their favorite. It has a nice texture and color. Don't laugh - I do smell my cats' canned food and Fancy Feast has a pleasant, meaty smell unlike others I've smelled. I don't trust canned foods that have a grayish color which this does not. I will keep buying."
5.0,fancy-feast-poultry-beef-classic-pate,13.21,24,3.0,"Two senior lady cats are totally Fancy Feast girls.  And this mix includes all their favorites.  Geat product (grain free canned foods) and good deal, especially on auto ship.  Like the a/s discount and the quick shipping too. Chewy is good!!!!"
5.0,fancy-feast-poultry-beef-classic-pate,13.21,24,3.0,Is excellent my cat is extremely picky and this is the only type that she will eat.  It also has to be the same two flavors. She actually tries  to pull the can out of the box
3.0,fancy-feast-poultry-beef-classic-pate,13.21,24,3.0,"I am unable to rate this product fairly because neither of my 2 cats really care for this canned food leaving half or more in their dishes each feeding. I thought the texture, moistness, and overall appearance seemed good. Just goes to show that a human cat mom can't always know what her fur baby will like until they've try it.  My local Humane Society was very happy to take it off my hands :)"
3.0,fancy-feast-poultry-beef-classic-pate,13.21,24,3.0,"This is a brand that my vet recommended a few years ago.  My cats were getting picky about their food, so I gave this a try.  However they did not like it.  Maybe they would have liked the regular and not the pate?"
5.0,fancy-feast-poultry-beef-classic-pate,13.21,24,3.0,"My cat loves this cat food -she has been a ""meat lover"" since she was a kitten - has no interest in fish. Buying it buy the case is sure better than purchasing all those single cans!"
3.0,fancy-feast-poultry-beef-classic-pate,13.21,24,3.0,"My one cat loved them all, but she will eat almost anything. However, her sister would not eat the beef pate (she is finicky). I will try something different in my next order. All in all I like Chewy very much."
5.0,fancy-feast-poultry-beef-classic-pate,13.21,24,3.0,"This is the first time we ever tasted this Poultry and Beef flavor, and we absolutely love it.  We smell it as soon as Mom opens the can, and we come running.  Highly recommend it!"

5.0,fancy-feast-poultry-beef-classic-pate,13.21,24,3.0,Basically exactly what you're expecting. Fancy Feast pates are a classic for a reason. Decent quality at an affordable price. Cats love all flavors I've tried.
5.0,fancy-feast-poultry-beef-classic-pate,13.21,24,3.0,"I purchased this Fancy Feast Variety pack of beef, chicken feast, and turkey food because my cats love these foods.

Even better when I mix the gel canned with the gravy canned.   Having only one cat that requires this food due to bladder stones I'm so happy my other guy loves the food just as much.

the morsels alone so I put half this and half morsels.  I feel bad because he loves to eat and will have to do this the rest of his life."
5.0,royal-canin-veterinary-diet-urinary,49.39,24,5.8,"My cat eats most things until she had to go on cd for urinary tract infections. She ate it ok for a short time time but then would leave it before finishing. Tried the SO at vets suggestion (they don’t carry it) saying the company works hard to make their food palatable. She licks the bowl clean, much to the disappointment of the dogs!"

Well I was lucky to catch it early and we got him on meds and prescription food to hopefully avoid surgery. My cat ate the wet food with no issues at all. He loves it, I'm in the process of getting him to eat the dry and the wet food now that we are in the clear. I wish it was cheaper but you got to do what's best for them if you care! Its definitely worth the money to keep him from getting blocked"

5.0,royal-canin-veterinary-diet-urinary,49.39,24,5.8,My cat would never eat canned food. Nothing but the same kind of dry food.  Then he had surgery for urinary tract stones and had to have wet food. Now he won't eat anything but Royal Canin SO.  He begs for it all day and night.

5.0,royal-canin-veterinary-diet-urinary,49.39,24,5.8,"I struggled for about a year to get my little girl to eat the Science Diet C/D canned food. She hated it! I tried to make it more appealing by mixing in other foods, tuna water, anything I could think of, but she still would only eat small amounts and without much vigor. When I switched to the Royal Canin, it was like night and day. She scarfs this down like she'll never eat again. She asks to be fed. That never happened on the Science Diet. The C/D is pretty nasty looking. It's kind of chunky and crumbly, more like ground turkey or something, and even when adding water is still difficult to smash up. The Royal Canin is smooth and water can be added easily to make it into a nice little gruel"
5.0,royal-canin-veterinary-diet-urinary,49.39,24,5.8,"My cats have to have urinary so. This is one of the two flavors they make in the wet food. Fortunately my cats like this flavor, the other smaller can flavor and the dry food."

When I learned I needed to go to a urinary prescription diet I thought they would not be happy. In addition, this food is a cake type wet food that I thought would not be desirable. I found they love this food! I ordered the Hills Urinary prescription foods as well. They like this the best!!!"

4.0,royal-canin-veterinary-diet-urinary,49.39,24,5.8,I believe both foods are great choices however my two cats have gotten tired of CD and lack of variety (I do not use any fish products for either).  I asked my vet for other options and Royal Canin was one.  The both LOVE the flavor and consistency of the gel as opposed to the chunkier variety.
5.0,royal-canin-veterinary-diet-urinary,49.39,24,5.8,"My vet prescribed this recently for my two cats, and I was concerned since one is a picky eater, plus it only comes in larger cans and the cats only eat half in the morning and half at night - and they dislike refrigerated food.  But this stuff they both love, even right from the fridge!  And cheaper than getting from the vet"

We tried all of the prescription foods out there, and this particular variety of this brand is the only one he will eat. Chewy had a better price than what I could get locally, but a number of the cans arrived dented - which is why I only gave it 4 stars."
5.0,royal-canin-veterinary-diet-urinary,49.39,24,5.8,This is a great product and an incredible price. I searched high and low for the best possible price because I’m disabled and on a limited budget chewy offered the best price by far. The product is also great because not only is it great for my 18 year cat with urinary crystals but it’s safe for her to take with her being diabetic. She also really enjoys the it!

He had a complete blockage and was close to death when I got him to the vet. 2 surgeries (he re-blocked) and $1300 later, the vet recommended Royal Canin Urinary SO. She sent us home with both wet and dry versions, so I mixed the two. I give him some dry food mixed with wet food and some extra water and he loves it. He's been on this specific diet for about a year now, and no blockage problems."

5.0,royal-canin-veterinary-diet-urinary,49.39,24,5.8,"One of my young cats had urinary issues suddenly a few weeks ago.  Our vet prescribed the Urinary SO.  He doesn’t love this food.  Much prefers the morsels.  But, he is currently eating about 8 oz of canned foods per day so I needed a more economical option than offered by my vet.   I was amazed at the speed of the delivery. Hoping to add the Urinary dry soon and I will get it from Chewy."

2.0,royal-canin-veterinary-diet-urinary,49.39,24,5.8,My cat doesn't like it. I thought I would try it for some variety. He will eat the morsles with gravy type but not the gel canned food.
5.0,royal-canin-veterinary-diet-urinary,49.39,24,5.8,"Discovered kidney stones when xraying for bowel issues. This food helped dissolve the type of stones he had. So, we now need to stay on this to keep any more at bay. I was feeding the chunk one, but decided to try this, since it is more like what he was used to prior. He took to it just fine. I alter between the two types now just to give him something different, since this only comes in one flavor. Wish they had other flavor options and a grain free option, as that is what we are used to feeding. Ordering is easy and delivered to my door fast! Packaging of products is great. No damage in delivery."
3.0,royal-canin-veterinary-diet-urinary,49.39,24,5.8,"My cat complains every time I feed him the canned food, but he was always a picky eater.

5.0,royal-canin-veterinary-diet-urinary,49.39,24,5.8,"This food has worked extremely well to flush my cat's system after a UTI with bloody urine and struvite crystals. I mix 1/4 of a can with 2 Tbs of water and feed it to her 4X per day with the moderate calorie dry food as a snack. Her urinary output has increased 10 fold which gives me great confidence her bladder issues are being resolved. She is also more lively and playful, it's incredible."

4.0,royal-canin-veterinary-diet-urinary,49.39,24,5.8,"My 10 year male cat has issues with urinary blockage, very limited with diet. He did not like the Royal Canin morsels in gravy but he likes this one.  I add a tablespoon of water and mix it.  I didn’t give it 5 stars as I wish the can was smaller.  It would be easier at feeding time as he only eats a little at a time and the cold leftovers are not as tasty for him."

Our awesome vet recommended this as one of the best long term solutions. So far it's worked great! Our cat has not seemed to get tired of it yet and as long as she has a steady supply of it her urinary problems are nonexistant. Compared to continued vet bills this product is a steal!"

5.0,hills-prescription-diet-cd-multicare,48.99,24,5.5,"When you place your first order, be sure to note the name and phone number of your vet if you don't have a copy of the prescription. Chewy will call the vet directly!                 
 I think after a while they'll learn to *love* it because this is the only wet food I will be putting out for them. Peter had surgery and he needs this food to help with his bladder issues. It came highly recommended by our vet. I can also let my other cat eat it to avoid any possible problems in the future.  They seem to really like it. So, we're all good.  They're also getting the prescription dry food to supplement the wet food."
1.0,hills-prescription-diet-cd-multicare,48.99,24,5.5,"My cat ate one bite of this food. From that point on, he would not touch it. He sniffs and backs away.

Unfortunately, I have half a tray (12 cans) left that I can't use (the other 12 cans I ended up throwing away after my cat would not eat it."
3.0,hills-prescription-diet-cd-multicare,48.99,24,5.5,"After an emergency visit and a 3 day stay at the hospital, my male cat who had a total urethra blockage was sent home with a prescription for this food and a few others to help eliminate the crystals he is making. I'm still not sure if he likes it. Cats can be finicky. I may have to try a different flavor or brand. Chewy was super easy to work with to get this prescription filled."
5.0,hills-prescription-diet-cd-multicare,48.99,24,5.5,"Our female cat was diagnosed with crystals, no stones but soon to follow. She took to it right away. My vet also approved it for my Male cat for prevention. He did not go for it at first but over a two week period he is now eating it. It is a pate but a very loose plate. It would be awesome if Hills started offering the CD foods in 3oz. cans. Overall positive"
5.0,hills-prescription-diet-cd-multicare,48.99,24,5.5,"My little orange and white boy had crystals in his bladder, doc put him on the ""stress"" version of this food but since he's 14lbs, I couldn't afford the smaller cans. Reading the reviews I was getting nervous that he wouldn't like the RX food... to my relief, he DOES! Actually, my other kitty loves it so much I've decided to just feed it to both of them-- makes it much easier. No more urinary problems and happy, well-fed kitties!"
5.0,hills-prescription-diet-cd-multicare,48.99,24,5.5,My cat with history of cystitis can only eat this food. My #2 cat loves it too so I feed it to both to prevent problems in each. Thank you Chewy for making it so easy to get this special food. And not have to lug it up flights of stairs
5.0,hills-prescription-diet-cd-multicare,48.99,24,5.5,I switched to this brand from Royal Canin urinary SO bc the RC only came in one flavor. My persian fur ball is enjoying this chicken flavor as well as the fish flavor and I find it easier to pour into his bowl since it’s mushier than the Royal Canin and I don’t have to chop the food up. If you need urinary care with a variety of flavors I recommend this.
5.0,hills-prescription-diet-cd-multicare,48.99,24,5.5,"Our big cat had 50 bladder stones, so now use this soft food and the C/D dry food. I use this soft food as a way to administer the laxative our big cat also needs. She suffers from a mega colon and, well, details are not pleasant. Even our other cat will eat this food; being a schizoid Siamese does not like soft foods."
2.0,hills-prescription-diet-cd-multicare,48.99,24,5.5,"I accidentally ordered the larger cans. Then thought..that’s ok..,  I will just use these up. The formula seems different. There aren’t as many chunks of wood look like vegetables etc. Neither one of my cats will eat this and my eight month old kitten eats just about anything !"
1.0,hills-prescription-diet-cd-multicare,48.99,24,5.5,"Was hoping the cat would like this because as far as I can tell, it is the only one in the 5.5 oz size and is considerably cheaper per ounce than the 2.9 oz cans.  But he hates it.  Will have almost nothing to do with it.  He loves the chicken stew and the tuna.  Not sure why they can't sell those in this size can and charge less.  Can't be that much difference in the cost of ingredients for them."
4.0,hills-prescription-diet-cd-multicare,48.99,24,5.5,"My cat needs it due to urinary problems.  I have to puree it as my cat is picky and doesn't like chunks.  But I think it is quality food and helps with his urinary problems.  In order to save money, companies are now making cans that dent very easily so about 1/2 the cans always come dented.  This is not a reflection on Chewy."
5.0,hills-prescription-diet-cd-multicare,48.99,24,5.5,It was a mistake. I meant to get the stew but so glad I got this. He loves it. I was wondering about how to send it back but decided to try it. I’m so glad I did. Thanks Chewy for all you do. We love Chewy!!
5.0,hills-prescription-diet-cd-multicare,48.99,24,5.5,"I am relieved that  you carry this item. Maggie, who has, up until now, been very fussy re food, likes the c/d. This is a relief as she has to have this kind of food. I am so very pleased with Chewy: what a blessing you are."

3.0,hills-prescription-diet-cd-multicare,48.99,24,5.5,I usually buy the small cd cans which I feed twice a day. So I purchased the large cans thinking I can get two meals from one can. My boy likes it as soon as it comes out the can but he won’t touch it for his second feeding.  I will go back to the small cans.
1.0,hills-prescription-diet-cd-multicare,48.99,24,5.5,I accidentally ordered this variety and in the larger can which was my mistake--the labels look identical on the website and are such a small picture that I didn't notice it was different than my usual order.  My cat does not seem to like it as much as the stew variety.

So hope it will help to prevent any future blockage episodes, since it was very stressful and painful (still is) experience for kitty and very and traumatic moments for whole family."
1.0,hills-prescription-diet-cd-multicare,48.99,24,5.5,I bought all four kinds of urinary care cat food for my cat. He had surgery to take care of things and he was recommended this kind of cat food. I only wish that he would eat it. But he won't. I tried adding chicken soup to make it taste better and he liked the soup but barely touched the cat food. I`ve tried adding different things to it but it doesn't help. He will eat his regular brand of cat food he likes but nothing from Hills. He's my little buddy and I`m doing all I can for him but no one seems to care if cats like this kind of food or not. Hills needs to make more favors with more textures. And smaller sized cans would help to cut down on the waste and my added costs. I really don't know
4.0,hills-prescription-diet-cd-multicare,48.99,24,5.5,"The veterinarian prescribed both the dry and the canned Urinary Care c/d, but she said my cat will recover faster if he eats the canned food.  I first purchased a bag of the dry c/d, but the crystals were still present in my cat's urine at his follow-up appointment 4 weeks later.  So I purchased canned c/d, which my cat just eats up but I am only giving him 1/2 a can per day along with the dry food.  (He likes the dry c/d, too.)  The recommended daily feeding amount is 1-3/4 cans of food per day, which I simply cannot afford."

It is formulated to maintain a well balanced ph level in the urine and prevent blockage. It is also a good source of protein and water intake. This product is good for both of my cats.

The only negative I can say about this product is it doesn’t come in the 2.9-oz cans. He only eats a half of the 5.5-oz can and he won’t eat the other half if it has been in the fridge. I just purchased the chicken and vegetables flavor in the small cans. I really hope he likes that flavor as well as he likes the plain chicken!"

I have to doctor it with some kind of saucy liquid cat food to get them to (reluctantly) eat it. I’m sure it is good for them but if they won’t eat it, what good is it. I’ll have to try different Urinary Care food to try to encourage them to eat. And all these special foods are very expensive. About $2 a can. So, great, healthy product, if your cats will eat it."

As long as I can get him to drink enough he’s fine, but stupid me quit adding water to his food (lazy mistake) and then my cat developed chrystals & started having difficulty peeing, poor little guy.

3.0,hills-prescription-diet-cd-multicare,48.99,24,5.5,"Based on our cat's reaction to this food, it is just 'ok' - they eat it because they have no choice.  Wish they could make it a little more palatable - and affordable.  It's sad that Hill's charges what they do, for this food - we have to have it to take good care of our kitties; we don't have a choice - and it's incredibly expensive for what it is.  However, thanks to Chewy we are getting it at a better price than ever before.

However, the ingredients in this food make me hesitant to continue feeding.  Pork by-products is the #1 ingredient, and I have on several occasions found little bits of strange cartilage-looking pieces in the food, maybe half a centimeter in diameter.  

Maybe I'm just being a picky human, but I've never seen such things in other wet foods.  I'm not educated enough in pet foods to know if this is concerning at all, and I expect pork by-products to be a unsavory (to humans) mix of pig parts, but mmmm... just wanted to share this."

we have to do it slowly, not enough flavor in this brand to entice them."
5.0,blue-buffalo-healthy-gourmet-variety,10.98,12,3.0,I just wanted to break the monotony for my kitty and give him decent food rather than the other food that comes out dried up or smothered in gravy.
5.0,blue-buffalo-healthy-gourmet-variety,10.98,12,3.0,Since poor little Shadow had some kind of allergy where she throws up and breaks out. Blue Buffalo seems to be helping her and she loves it so far. I have 5 kitties so hopefully I can keep affording this for her.
1.0,blue-buffalo-healthy-gourmet-variety,10.98,12,3.0,Too much like pate...not flaky as described....not wet or juicy enough.Duck did not eat it so I gave it away
5.0,blue-buffalo-healthy-gourmet-variety,10.98,12,3.0,"my 11 year old furbaby began to eat a little bit and walk away.  she was losing weight.  so I got one pack of blue buffalo and put 1/4th of a can in her bowl.  at the second meal she was dancing and waiting for her bowl.  third meal had her tearing around the corner in anticipation of meal time.  I am happy to see her enjoying meals again, and giving me lots of loving afterward."
1.0,blue-buffalo-healthy-gourmet-variety,10.98,12,3.0,I wish my cats would eat this stuff but they flat do not like it. I have thrown away more than they have eaten. You think at least one of my cats out of two would like it but they won't even eat the tuna flavored one!! I tried everything to get them to eat it too. They just turn their noses up. Definitely will not buy again.
4.0,blue-buffalo-healthy-gourmet-variety,10.98,12,3.0,I have this food on autoship every week and it never disappoints to come on time and the babies love it.
1.0,blue-buffalo-healthy-gourmet-variety,10.98,12,3.0,"My 2 boys did not like this stuff at ALL.  Each time I put the 3 different flavours in their dishes, they took TWO BITES, and then LEFT them.  I ended up throwing more than 90% of this crap out.  PLUS, they smelled BAD (IMO)...and I think my boys thought so too, because when they sniffed them, they made faces."
3.0,blue-buffalo-healthy-gourmet-variety,10.98,12,3.0,"Meh. My 3 pickers started out with the 1st order  of this variety pack loving it.  So, I ordered more. It was all I could do to get them through the next order, and they no longer want it.  I even tried recently just buying one more single can of it from the local pet store and they still didn't want it.  I will say that they are all picky, but they will gulp other brands vs this. Definitely wouldn't discourage someone from trying it though."
5.0,blue-buffalo-healthy-gourmet-variety,10.98,12,3.0,I have 6 rescues each wth their own opinions on food. this was a winner and I loved the ingredients. A few of the cats have issues either sensitive tummies or immune disorders so this was great. I'm just sad you don't get a whole lot of product for your buck but it is quality.
5.0,blue-buffalo-healthy-gourmet-variety,10.98,12,3.0,"Both of my boys love the Blue Buffalo food and digest it really well. One of my cats was throwing up occasionally when he tried other foods, I had them on IAMS and Rachel Ray Nutrish previously. My older cat was also much more interested in this food than in any of the other canned food brands I tried. We are definitely sticking with Blue Buffalo."
5.0,blue-buffalo-healthy-gourmet-variety,10.98,12,3.0,My cat will not eat turkey or duck flavored foods but she loves all three flavors in this pack! I will be buying again.

5.0,blue-buffalo-healthy-gourmet-variety,10.98,12,3.0,My cats love this food. They all come running if they see me heading that direction giving me big kitten eyes and weaving in and out of my legs until the cab is opened. I have two cats that can’t stand each other but will eat this side by side without a grumble or incident because they are laser focused on the grub before them!
5.0,blue-buffalo-healthy-gourmet-variety,10.98,12,3.0,"My cat has recently lost quite a bit of weight and I got this food to maintain her current size, while also focusing on more of a protein-heavy diet. She's been on this food for about 5 months now and her weight has stayed the same, and she's as healthy as ever! She has a ton of energy and as a bonus, she absolutely loves this food. Gobbles it up faster than I can scoop it out of the can (like I said, she's a bit of a fatty...). Would highly recommend!!"
5.0,blue-buffalo-healthy-gourmet-variety,10.98,12,3.0,Our cats are such picky eaters and we were so frustrated trying so many types of food for them. We finally tried Blue buffalo and they loved it. The quality is high and the texture is very nice for them. Thanks Blue Buffalo!

Like as soon as they went my entire house stank. I monitored to see which food was the culprit and it was this one. Now I give them only wellness and fancy feast kitten food and I’m not saying it smells like roses but it isn’t abnormally disgusting. If you’re noticing the same thing, try another brand."
5.0,blue-buffalo-healthy-gourmet-variety,10.98,12,3.0,1 of our 3 cats is very picky and she licked her bowl clean and then cleaned up what the other 2 cats left behind. In the year we have had her she has never even finished her portion of the other can foods we have tried.

4.0,blue-buffalo-healthy-gourmet-variety,10.98,12,3.0,"I think this is a great quality food.  However my two cats are pretty picky, they ate it but not as diligently as with other brands.  I am going to try Authority this next time. If they pick at that I will go back to Wellness Core."

5.0,blue-buffalo-healthy-gourmet-variety,10.98,12,3.0,My cats get bored eating the same thing day after day.  The variety pack offers the opportunity for them to get some different flavor once in while. Basically they’re fed the tuna shrimp combination dinners. Some chicken now and then is right up their alley and ends there boredom. The convenience of having this delivered automatically every three weeks makes my life so easy.
2.0,blue-buffalo-healthy-gourmet-variety,10.98,12,3.0,"Cats won't eat it. So won't order again. None of the 11 cats I feed would eat it, so I'll go back to the other foods I buy for them."

5.0,blue-buffalo-healthy-gourmet-variety,10.98,12,3.0,All four of my cats love all the flavors.Its good to know there is nothing but good stuff in this food.
5.0,blue-buffalo-healthy-gourmet-variety,10.98,12,3.0,"It turns out that our fussy girl, Ms. Chairman Meow, truly only wants pate, not this flaked variety. I will likely pass it on to a less finicky feline."
2.0,blue-buffalo-healthy-gourmet-variety,10.98,12,3.0,"I am dissappointed that the description does not match the food.  This is not flaked, but compressed into little squares.  Our picky cat does like it better than some others otherwise I'd give 1 star"

She started having some health issues and I needed to add a soft food. I brought her the flaked and she had no issues eating it! So now she eats both dry and canned food. She's enjoying her older years.
5.0,blue-buffalo-healthy-gourmet-variety,10.98,12,3.0,Cat seems to like it. Would buy again. Just trying out different kinds and brands. Love chewy.com.

2.0,blue-buffalo-healthy-gourmet-variety,10.98,12,3.0,The actual food may be fine but it’s way to dry to please my cats. The more gravy the better or they won’t touch it!

1.0,blue-buffalo-healthy-gourmet-variety,10.98,12,3.0,"I have one picky eater and one 15 lb (she's on a diet okay!) girl who usually eats everything you put in front of her. The picky cat walked away from it, and the chubby one sniffed it, put her paw in it, tried violently to shake it off and then laid down in front of it and cried until we opened something else. Dramatic? Absolutely. To the point about her feelings? Definitely. It was resounding no from this house. :("
1.0,blue-buffalo-healthy-gourmet-variety,10.98,12,3.0,Unfortunately my 6 year old prima dona did not like any of the varieties of Blue Buffalo. She is usually a tuna and seafood junkie but turned her nose up and walked away. I'm back to Fancy Feast which she loves.
5.0,blue-buffalo-healthy-gourmet-variety,10.98,12,3.0,My 2 boys loved this food! They are picky on occasion and I forgot I ordered this so I was nervous I wasted money... but they loved it!!! Good combination of choices for them and an excellent brand!
5.0,blue-buffalo-healthy-gourmet-variety,10.98,12,3.0,My guys like it better than Fancy Feast  and it might be healthier.
5.0,blue-buffalo-healthy-gourmet-variety,10.98,12,3.0,My cat was being picky and not eating the food she's been eating fine for months. Decided to get her this in the hopes she would eat it and she did! She loves this stuff!
5.0,blue-buffalo-healthy-gourmet-variety,10.98,12,3.0,My fur babies would definitely give me a thumbs-up..... if they had thumbs!!
5.0,blue-buffalo-healthy-gourmet-variety,10.98,12,3.0,I was having a problem with one of the cats throwing up with my other soft food - but no issues since I switched to Healthy Gourmet.  They only get a tablespoon a day - but it seems to have made a difference.
3.0,blue-buffalo-healthy-gourmet-variety,10.98,12,3.0,My cat doesn't seem to love this food. Eats about half and leaves the rest to go to waste. He's not particularly picky so I don't know what gives. Probably won't purchase again.
4.0,blue-buffalo-healthy-gourmet-variety,10.98,12,3.0,"Tom my beloved cat was listless and seemed to have allergies with gunk in his ees when my vet recommended a change i food. We went to Blue Buffalo older cat with hairball an one month later he is bouncy, no issues with eyes. Increased appetite adn enthusiasm to be with people. Above all the most beautiful shiny coat and brightest sparkling eyes. Thank you !!"
1.0,blue-buffalo-healthy-gourmet-variety,10.98,12,3.0,My cats don't like this food at all!   They did ok with the pate but won't eat the flake and I bought two boxes
4.0,blue-buffalo-healthy-gourmet-variety,10.98,12,3.0,"Well, I have 5 rescued purr babies and 1 just loves it so much that she won’t share!!! This is really ok as the cans are small and sharing isn’t necessary. The only problem I have with the product is, when shipped with litter, the cans can be crushed and leak. Has nothing to do with the food quality though. As I said one of my girls can’t get enough...  LoL"
5.0,blue-buffalo-healthy-gourmet-variety,10.98,12,3.0,Tried it the first time  -   they LOVED the Tuna  -  wish I could have gotten a case of JUST the Tuna
5.0,blue-buffalo-healthy-gourmet-variety,10.98,12,3.0,All four of our cats loved this food.  However the cans are small and that makes this good food much too expensive for this Social Security recipient.  I probably will only Order this every other month to give them a treat.
1.0,blue-buffalo-healthy-gourmet-variety,10.98,12,3.0,Well this is not the one....dog likes it!!  Will keep trying other brands :/
5.0,blue-buffalo-healthy-gourmet-variety,10.98,12,3.0,"This canned food doesn't stay in the plate long.
Our cat was tired of the same thing and she is a super happy kitty with this."
5.0,blue-buffalo-healthy-gourmet-variety,10.98,12,3.0,"I recently switched from other brand to this product. it used to be one cat likes it, the other won't. But with this brand both of my cats love the food, and finish it every time. Price is very good compare to other websites. I'd recommend this to other cat lovers."
2.0,blue-buffalo-healthy-gourmet-variety,10.98,12,3.0,I'm sure this is quality food.  I have purchased other Blue products with a positive outcome.  This time my 2 cats would not eat this.  They prefer a food that's chopped with gravy and not a Pate form.  My usual is Fancy feast gravy lovers.  Will stick to that.
2.0,blue-buffalo-healthy-gourmet-variety,10.98,12,3.0,"My rescue is twelve years old and a very finicky eater. He prefers seafood to poultry, but I couldn't even get him to eat the tuna flavored, which has always been his favorite. The canned food itself didn't have a lot of gravy or juice which is a must have for my feline. If your cat is picky like mine, who won't eat paté or big chunks of meat, avoid this food. Despite being listed as flaked, the consistency was closer to that of paté."
4.0,blue-buffalo-healthy-gourmet-variety,10.98,12,3.0,"I think my cat like chicken better than fish, great product though !"
5.0,blue-buffalo-healthy-gourmet-variety,10.98,12,3.0,Certain fancy first made my cat throw up.  This food seem to agree with both of us.

Seems unlikely that this happened during shipping since the shipping carton was intact with no damages. Since this is the second time this happened, I wonder if chewy is intentionally shipping damaged sets. Will definitely not order canned pet food from Chewy any more."
5.0,fancy-feast-delights-cheddar-grilled,15.59,24,3.0,"My 2 kitties love the texture and flavor of the cheddar food.  Can't find bulk package locally, so this is ideal.

After trying to find a wet cat food flavor he'd appreciate (and actually eat), I decided to give these cheddar delights a try. He devours these 3 flavors, leaving absolutely no evidence in the bowl. 
If your cat loves harassing you when you are eating cereal, just to get in a few laps of the left over milk, licks the whipped cream off of any desserts, and demands to be given a few licks of your vanilla ice cream-this would be the brand for that kitty!!"
4.0,fancy-feast-delights-cheddar-grilled,15.59,24,3.0,"Just fyi - this was supposed to be 8 of each fish, turkey and chicken variety, but for the first time since I've been purchasing, the package contained 10 of the whitefish and 6 of the turkey -- instead of 8 each of these 2.  Very strange.  Don't know if it was a one-off or there were others."
5.0,fancy-feast-delights-cheddar-grilled,15.59,24,3.0,"My fur-baby, Harmony, loves the Fancy Feast Cheddar AND the Fancy Feast Creamy Delights. She cannot make the decision which she “fancies” the most. So, she gets both cause she’s worth it!

I recommend this to anyone who wants to give their cat a treat, because this isn't really healthy, but I think it's good to give to your cat when she wants to eat something tasty. I give it to my cat after she's had her meals of nutritionally balanced food, which isn't her favorite but I love to give her this as a reward for eating healthy :)"

5.0,nutro-perfect-portions-grain-free,13.97,12,2.65,I purchased several flav’s of this Nutro for my kitty and the turkey seems to be her fav. It can be a bit frustrating bc her taste choices change depending on the brand of wet food. It’s taken me a while to find what she likes. Thankfully she’s happy with this and it’s healthy for her. The texture and smell is good quality compared to others. I would highly recommend if you have a fussy kitty.
2.0,nutro-perfect-portions-grain-free,13.97,12,2.65,"I had high hopes for this; my boys are 8 & 11 and will only eat pate versions of canned food. Recently they quit eating their previous food, so I decided to try this, as I was trying to stick with a grain-free option. Neither the turkey nor the chicken were a hit. I swear someone needs to develop ""cat food flights""... sort of like wine or beer flights. A sample of several options; let them try it, pick a favorite and let me move on with my life. :) It gets expensive and wasteful trying to find something they'll eat. This is probably a perfectly fine food, but didn't work for my feline family."
5.0,nutro-perfect-portions-grain-free,13.97,12,2.65,My cat Oscar really likes this food.  I like that it's grain free and I love the perfect portions. I give him one at a time which makes it easier being that it is portion controlled.

5.0,nutro-perfect-portions-grain-free,13.97,12,2.65,"My 2 cats regular food is dry food, so I use this once a week as a treat. This small size works for me. My Persian has given me fits before with other size canned food. If she isn’t hungry, it sits. If it’s cold, it sits. If I warm it up a little, it sits. So, I have another cat, and now this is working for me. Their treat is one container for both. If my Persian isn’t hungry for it, the other cat finishes it. I’m not wasting food anymore. I wish more companies would offer this size."

4.0,nutro-perfect-portions-grain-free,13.97,12,2.65,"Our 3 cats enjoyed this food but aren't particularly picky. For that, this gets 4 stars. It seems like quality food, for sure.
We didn't like the packaging or the price per ounce vs the Nurtro cans (my fault for not looking at the $/oz before buying). We always mix 1 oz of wet food and 1 oz of water for each of our 3 cats and I thought these would be easy to split up like a can, but they're ~1.3 oz and really difficult to open if your hands are slightly wet. Then if you're holding it with any pressure it squirts the liquid out on your hand or counter or wherever. Also, I should've thought twice about ordering something over-packaged in plastic. Anyway, our cats equally enjoy the canned duck"

She won't eat anything that's not fresh.  Honestly I don't know how she has lived this long.  She weighs 6pounds."
3.0,nutro-perfect-portions-grain-free,13.97,12,2.65,"It's ""different,"" true, but not convenient. Each little package is sealed with heavy foil, which is very difficult to pull off. Plus, when you compare the cost with that of Nutro canned chicken (minced), it's more expensive, and of course the can is easier to open. I purchased this item two or three times but finally decided that it wasn't worth the trouble or expense. My cat DID like the food, but she likes the canned minced chicken just as well."
5.0,nutro-perfect-portions-grain-free,13.97,12,2.65,"My 14 year old cat has always only eaten half a can of food, no matter the size of the can. I've tried saving the other half to give to her later, but she refuses to eat cold food and won't eat it if you reheat it either, although our dogs loved the special treat of eating her leftovers, I always felt it was a waste of money to buy a whole can for her to only eat half. Then I found these. They are perfect for her. She gets her half can portion that she loves, and the other half remains fresh so there is no wasted food. The only downside is our dogs miss their ""special treat"" of her leftover food lol."

I love that it is so easy to serve and the measured portion keeps me from over-feeding. I also like that it is manufactured in the USA and the containers can be recycled.
3.0,nutro-perfect-portions-grain-free,13.97,12,2.65,"Talk about waste!  This is catfood in plastic tubs (which I personally find obnoxious to get open); and then the tubs are divided in half, nearly doubling the amount of plastic. Really?  Simply as a marketing novelty?  Me, I don't find it that onerous to simply divide a 5.5 oz can in half with a spoon. The food itself, however, is well-liked by most of my cats; and there are a restricted number of ingredients which lessen potential allergens (which is why I decided to try these).  I can find other similar alternatives, though, in packaging far less damaging to the planet."

He is cleaning up his bowl with the Nutro, and I was thrilled to see it is higher in protein than the other food, as my vet says that high protein is good for cats with his issues.  He's older and has fewer teeth, so the pate form is easy for him to eat.  Here's hoping that with the Nutro and his medication, he'll start gaining weight!"

5.0,nutro-perfect-portions-grain-free,13.97,12,2.65,I was looking for a good wet cat food in the portioned out containers and it was surprisingly hard to find- they were all the really cheap & bad ingredients ones. But this one passed the test & my cat approves!
5.0,nutro-perfect-portions-grain-free,13.97,12,2.65,A common theme with my cat was the leftover wet food in the dish that would look gross after a few hours. I switched my cat to this & it's just as described: perfect portions. My cat loves it & it also prevents overfeeding. I would recommend it if you find your cat leaving behind wet food leftovers or want to find a better balance with the dry food.

5.0,nutro-perfect-portions-grain-free,13.97,12,2.65,My 8 year old girl loves this and it's packed with good protein! She is used to the Nutro regular green free and I wanted to up her protein since she is getting older and was worried she might not like the new flavor as she is pretty picky. But she loved it! Definitely a winner :-)
