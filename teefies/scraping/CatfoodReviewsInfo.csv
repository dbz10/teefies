"Newman's Own Organic Grain-Free 95% Turkey & Liver Dinner Canned Cat Food, 5.5-oz, case of 24",Rose,5,"This brand has all the ingredients I was looking for with no veggies, grain or soy.  My cat loved it the first time I put it out, however, then she didn't really want to eat it. She is definitely spoiled, so when I left it out for her and she knew mommy wasn't going to give in, she continued to eat it.  I want to give her a brand that is good for her, so if it means waiting a while before she eats, we will wait. I'm always reading the nutritional ingredients in wet cat food and it's difficult to find a brand that doesn't have grain, soy, veggies or any fillers.  I would definitely recommend Newman's Own Turkey & Liver and will continue to encourage my cat to eat it.  Thanks,",0

Really a near-perfect cat food - the absolute best my 20-year-old cat has ever been fed. A wet cat food that is free of grains, GMOs, meat by-products, and artificial ingredients.

for some reason this turkey cuts is super hard to open up. it is like they used super glue to seal food up, will hurt your hands/fingers if you have hand issues!! the chicken cut seal isn't so bad but, pretty strong seal too. gettting one of them thin westcott ceramic box cutter is probably a good idea if you have arthritis in your fingers too, what i use now so they can still enjoy these cuts",0

With this food, he eats it more often than not. My only complaint is that the food packaging does not state it is a grain-free food, and the print for the ingredients is too small to read.

What he likes is the gravy (someone please make a gravy only food/topper). I've purchased dozens of different foods and he just won't eat the meat.  Occasionally he'll nibble on minced, but that's it.  I end up tossing over 3/4 of a 3oz. can.  Glad to find the 'perfect portion' trays - they keep food waste to a minimum.  Honestly, due to the by-products, I wouldn't feed Sheba to a cat if it were their main source of nutrition. And if he even ate the whole portion I would go with Crave, but since he still pretty much just laps up the gravy this is a cheap way to give him his gravy fix.",2

They’ve eaten frozen raw food their whole lives, but have gotten very picky about it, and eat so gradually (grazing really) that it’s not practical to use it much anymore. They like canned food, but supermarket canned food makes them throw up (they have CKD). Plus, they leave a big percentage of those canned foods in the bowl. They won’t even touch the formulas made specifically for CKD.

Unfortunately they don't seem to care for it too much, which is a little strange, since previously they've immediately gulped down any wet food we've given them. They will eat this, but they pick at it over a long period of time whereas normally they eat their wet food portion within 10 minutes. So, I guess we will serve this food occasionally alongside others since it's definitely not their favorite although it is nutritious.

Like the other Kitten Formula, it is a very thick, paste-like puree (although this one is turkey-based, and darker in color). However, this version has fewer vegetables and other unnecessary filler ingredients, so I prefer it based on that.


I will admit that if NOT mixed with the shredded chicken food (I can't name it here), my kitten would not touch the Wellness Core as it's very thick and heavy. However, when mixed with the shredded chicken and some chicken broth, it creates a nice soupy",6

When my family chooses our pet food, we usually go with three categories. We start with fresh healthy ingredients, price, and of course will the pet eat it.

With Crave, the packaging was unique and allows the owner to split them in half for proper portioning. No more having to refrigerate the other half and lose it behind last weeks meatloaf.

Though I cannot speak for my cat, he seems to really like this food. He is very finnicky and will only eat wet food once in a while. And when he does, it has to be pate, and it has to be soft. Upon opening one portion, he came running over and was sniffing the container. I could barely get the pate into the bowl before he was eating it. He seemed to really enjoy it, and he ate the whole portion at once. That almost never happened with the Shebas.. which he usually loves.

I made the mistake of leaving one day with the packages on the kitchen counter instead of away in a cupboard.

One kitten will eat it grudgingly, one will eat it only as a last resort (i.e. after the better-liked food in her dish is gone, it's the middle of the night, and she's sure that she's starving), and my senior cat--who admittedly prefers certain lower-quality wet food varieties",5

I had to actually go out and buy another brand at the store to mix with all those cans to make it less like soup.  Sad that I now have to stop purchasing this flavor.  I don't know if it's the lot you all received or all retails have the same bad quality.  I think I'll go out and get a can from a local retailer that carries the brand (even though higher) to see if it's just your batches.  If so won't be buying this flavor from you again.,8

The quantity of liquid has reached a point where their average 76g dinner is 20g of liquid and very little food.  I'm not paying a premium price for a can of water.  This is now off my autoship.

We understand that cats can be picky, but our cats love this brand/flavor so our only rational conclusion is that there's a problem with batches. So what do we do?

First, I will say I was impressed with the nice packaging. It isn't hard to open and you don't have to worry about cutting your fingers on sharp metal lids like so many packaged wet cat food. I also didn't mind the smell of it as it really smelled like real food (which makes sense with the natural ingredients) instead of the typical gross cat food smell.
    I gave Crave to my two cats, ages 9 and 11. They typically eat dry cat food, but I was excited to try this since they are getting older and it would be much easier for them to eat. Not only did they love it and eat every last bite quickly, but they stood at the door ",0

She’s a 6 year old indoor/outdoor cat so she’s pretty active with hunting. I would not recommend this for older, indoor cat as i believe it has too much protein. Too much protein is not necessary for sedentary cats. It is also a problem for older cats as it can affect the kidneys in a negative way. I used to manage a veterinary office so I discussed this diet with many of my friends and previous coworkers. They definitely agree that it’s a great diet for a young active cat.

But after scooping it out I discovered there was more food than I normally give Kona for her dinner. -As a side note I use wet food as a supplemental to her always present dry food.- Initially she sniffed it and walked away without any interest, but after a few minutes she came back and gave it an experimental lick.

This one fits the bill. A single source of animal protein, no fish, grain free, limited ingredients. The cats are eating it well and it's not triggering the allergy symptoms.

I'll be honest, we (and the cats) really liked ""Instinct Limited Ingredient Diet Grain Free"" canned cat food which comes in duck and rabbit, but it is so expensive - 12 cans ",6

Mainly, because the litterbox stiiiiiinks when they're eating this, unlike when they're eating the regular Wilderness Turkey or Chicken pate flavors. Secondly, the cats seem to get more hungry and sooner when I'm feeding them this. Maybe it's because they like it so much they just get more excited for meals, but I've upped their meals to 3x per day with this kind of Wilderness food just so the they'll calm down. I believe this kind of Wilderness has fewer calories than the regular pate Wilderness. So in the long run, although they like it more, it makes they smellier and hungrier.",4

They goes nuts when I open a can of Mackerel for my dogs and I always give them some of that and it is why I thought they would flip for this recipe but maybe it is not as strong as the Mackerel and they are spoiled?????  I think varying their diets is beneficial so I will continue with this and maybe back off the Mackerel.  It is definitely worth trying as it could just be a personal taste issue with my two cats.,0

She hated it! I tried to make it more appealing by mixing in other foods, tuna water, anything I could think of, but she still would only eat small amounts and without much vigor. When I switched to the Royal Canin, it was like night and day. She scarfs this down like she'll never eat again. She asks to be fed. That never happened on the Science Diet. The C/D is pretty nasty looking. It's kind of chunky and crumbly, more like ground turkey or something, and even when adding water is still difficult to smash up. The Royal Canin is smooth and water can be added easily to make it into a nice little gruel ",5

Cats are obligate carnivores originally from the desert, direct descendants of the African Sand cat. Because cats are from the desert they’re  not supposed to drink much water, and they shouldn’t need it much since their natural prey of birds and rodents are 80% water, therefore I never feed them dry food since it’s less than 10% water making it impossible for them to drink enough water to make up for that deficit, where as canned wet food is typically 78% water.

If you have a cat in renal failure, I recommend you not autoship food; trying to figure out what food they'll eat, or even IF they'll eat at all, is a daily dilemma.

After my foster passed, another one of my cats had a senior panel done, which revealed a marker for being at-risk for renal failure. Our vet recommended feeding him a lower protein diet (prophylactically), so I tried feeding this food to him with a little of his",2

Now what's for dinner?"" I end up having to give them additional food to get them out of the kitchen.

I never use up a full-sized can when giving the boys wet food, so this really helps to eliminate food waste (and the risk of losing a can in the fridge). And with the foil ""lid"" and plastic container, it also keeps you from potentially cutting a finger when opening it, though it can take a bit of tugging to get it open. 

It smells like cat food, of course, but it seems to lack the strong, pungent odor that other types have and doesn't leave your hands covered in the smell (and the packaging helps prevent that, too). The texture is kind of dense, as expected",0

I feed it not only to my cats at home but also to a colony of strays and they all used to love this food; but now some won't eat it at all and some eat it reluctantly. I have been buying cases of this food at a time so this review is based on an above average quantity of their food. It is very sad to have had such a good product and have the quality decline so drastically. I am hesitant to recommend this product but am recommending in hopes they can resolve their quality issue soon; in my opinion there are few foods that are of the quality that H&G used to be.,31

Too bad for me. Not for them. They get by just fine. 

This is the only recipe made by Hound & Gatos that I have offered the pride that they simply choose to abstain from consuming. 

They were fed leftovers by folks in the apartments and those attending the beauty college, by the feral pride that occasionally shared its field and creek-caught bounty with them. They were born into a physical environment infused with the aromas of nearby delis, specialty coffee houses",7

The pieces are a little pinker, but the new Weruva formulation had a lot of randomly bloody bits, which felt more questionable to me.

After going through tons of brands, Triumph...triumphed! I decided I want my cats to have about 250kcals/day to maintain a healthy weight. Previously, on dry food, they were getting close to 300kcals and putting on too much weight. The 5.5oz cans of the Chicken n' Liver and Beef offer 215 and 220 kcals respectively per can AND it is the most affordable per ounce. Other brands are cheaper, but require you to feed more",13

I needed something as low cost but high quality as possible. I tried the beef & while the cats did eat it, it was a bit thick/concentrated which made it a little hard to maneuver when cold & sometimes cats wound up pushing the bowl around the room to try to get it. This formula is much lighter/moister so it solves those problem although maybe not quite as filling as the beef (you didnt have to use much) it depends what you are looking for. All the cats eat it included the pickiest 18 year old female who 99% of the time will forego eating altogether. All in all a GREAT cat food to have for multiple cats or have in your rotation",10

The price and the fact that it comes in large cans are pluses for me. It gets very expensive feeding 8 very large cats. I'm not fond of the rice flour in it but I also don't think fruits and veggies are good for cats either. Many grain free foods have large amounts of fruits and veggies. I used a feline carb/calorie calculator to calculate the carbs in this food and it's right at 3%. I am happy with this food and the cats eat it. It is also lower in carbs than many much higher priced foods. I would recommend you try it. Hope they continue to make the 13 oz. cans. Large cans ,20

After eating this food for ten days my cat began showing signs of nausea and pain. He was diagnosed with pancreatitis due to the fatty lamb food. After 4 1/2 months of treatment with 3 vets my beautiful cat had to be euthanized. Do not feed a high fat food to your cats or dogs. I lost my sweet cat who was everything to me.,6

I think this could be a 5-star product if only the morsels were a little smaller - about half the size they are currently. Not that cats don't have the capacity to eat them, but every cat I've ever had to whom I've fed morsels in gravy food licks off the morsels and maybe/maybe doesn't eat the morsels after that. And the morsels in this are on the larger end of the morsels in gravy varieties. Luckily my cats will eventually finish off the remaining morsels, though usually it's only after I slice what's left into smaller chunks. It could be way more of a nuisance if I weren't",3

"Purina Pro Plan Savor Adult Sole & Vegetable Entree in Sauce Canned Cat Food, 3-oz, case of 24",DogMomx4,5,"They all loved the sole flavor.  It was a nice change from the mainly turkey, chicken and salmon diet that they have been on.  Easily digestible and apparently very tasty too. Paws up for this flavor (and for all of the Purina Pro Plan “minced” flavors we’ve tried.). Cans are easy to open and the food isn’t “stinky”—actually looks fairly appetizing.  It’s a win for us!",0
